# Dialog System Technology Challenges 7 (DSTC 7)

## [Track 1 - Sentence Selection](http://workshop.colips.org/dstc7/proposals/Track%201%20Merged%20Challenge%20Extended%20Desscription_v2.pdf)

This challenge provides a partial conversation, and requires participants to select the correct next utterances from a set of candidates.
Unlike previous similar challenges, this task tries to push towards real world problems by introducing:

- A large number of candidates
- Cases where no candidate is correct
- External data

This challenge is offered with two goal oriented dialog datasets, used in 5 tasks.
A participant may participate in one, several, or all the subtasks.
